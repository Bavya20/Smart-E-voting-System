# üëÅÔ∏è Gesture-Based E-Voting System

A secure and accessible online voting system where users can cast their votes using **facial gestures** like **hand movements, eyebrow raises, or nose movements**, with a **virtual keyboard** for input ‚Äî built to help **elderly and differently-abled users** participate in digital voting without hurdles.

> üí° This was my **college mini project**, inspired by real-world challenges faced by elders in accessing traditional voting systems. I loved working on it because solving real problems is where my heart truly lies.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Why This Project Matters to me

Elderly and differently-abled people often find it hard to interact with conventional voting systems. This project was born out of a desire to make technology accessible for everyone ‚Äî especially those often left out.

The goal is to use AI and gesture recognition to create something meaningful and usable in the real world. üåç
